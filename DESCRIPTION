Description: Algorithms for fitting standard error adjusted EM based zero-inflated penalized coefficient paths for both zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. The penalties include Adaptive Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (A-LASSO), Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) and Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), and each possibly combining with L_2 penalty.
